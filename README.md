Asynchronous Python client for Tailwind garage door openers.

## About

This package allows you to control and monitor [Tailwind devices](https://gotailwind.com/)
programmatically. It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to
automate the behavior of a Tailwind device.

Additionally, this package contains a CLI tool, which can be used standalone,
proving a command-line interface to control and monitor Tailwind devices.

Known compatible and tested Tailwind devices:

- [Tailwind iQ3](https://gotailwind.com/products/iq3-smart-garage-controller)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library requires your Tailwind device to run at least firmware version v10.10.

For the development of this package, the hardware was kindly sponsored
and provided by [Tailwind](https://gotailwind.com/); thank you! ❤️

## Installation

```bash
pip install gotailwind
```

In case you want to use the CLI tools, install the package with the following
extra:

```bash
pip install gotailwind[cli]
```

## CLI usage

The tailwind CLI tool provided in this library provides all the functionalities
this library provides but from the command line.

The CLI comes with built-in help, which can be accessed by using the `--help`

```bash
tailwind --help
```

To scan for Tailwind devices on your network:

```bash
tailwind scan
```

To get the status of a device:

```bash
tailwind status --host 192.168.1.123
```

To open a door:

```bash
tailwind open --host 192.168.1.123
```

For more details, access the built-in help of the CLI using the `--help` flag.

## Python usage

Using this library in Python:

```python
import asyncio

from gotailwind import Tailwind, TailwindDoorOperationCommand, TailwindDoorState


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example of programmatically control a Tailwind garage door."""
    async with Tailwind(host="192.168.1.123", token="123456") as tailwind:
        # Get the device status
        status = await tailwind.status()

        # Print some information
        print(f"Device ID: {status.device_id}")
        print(f"Number of doors: {status.number_of_doors}")

        # Get the door object for the first door
        door = await tailwind.door_status(door=0)

        # Print current door status
        print(f"Door 1 is currently: {door.state}")

        # Change the door
        if door.state == TailwindDoorState.OPEN:
            door = await tailwind.operate(
                door=0, operation=TailwindDoorOperationCommand.CLOSE
            )
        else:
            door = await tailwind.operate(
                door=0, operation=TailwindDoorOperationCommand.OPEN
            )

        # Print current door status
        print(f"Door 1 is now: {door.state}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Changelog & releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.
- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up a development environment

The easiest way to start is by opening a CodeSpace here on GitHub, or by using
the [Dev Container][devcontainer] feature of Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]
- NodeJS 20+ (including NPM)

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
npm install
poetry install --extras cli
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
